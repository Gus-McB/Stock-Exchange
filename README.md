# Stock-Exchange
This repo contains the stock exchange project I have made in Java, it uses a multitude of data structures and object oriented principles.

This is one of my university assignments, the assignment is to create the necessary objects to create a functioning Stock Exchange. In the SRC you'll find a number of files under the student section that will contain my code that allows the exchange to run. The Junit testing file shows the functionality of the classes are correct and the marking file contains the test code of which matches all expected outcomes. The techniques used within this project are of Object-Oriented and Data Structure nature. A number of Stacks, Queues and Linked-Lists are used to provide brokers with the trades, this is done using generic objects.
